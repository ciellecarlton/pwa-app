## Description

The dictionary definition of 'Comptroller' is : a royal-household official who examines and supervises expenditures. Which means, the person who takes care of the finances. Also, there is a popular Drake song titled 'Controlla' and I thought it was a nice double entendre/ play on words. Pop refreance, tech referance and, finance referance. Computer.  Controlla. Comptroller. Enjoy.
